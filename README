This is ROBOSPECT, a program to automatically measure spectral line
profiles with minimal user interaction.  

Current availability and documentation are available at
http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/users/watersc1/robospect.html

Email <watersc1@ifa.hawaii.edu> or <julie@astro.as.utexas.edu> for
more information.

*** Installation Instructions *** 

The following libraries are used by ROBOSPECT:

  * libgsl : required. Tested to work with versions > v1.9.
  * libcfitsio : optional requirement to allow FITS image input.
  * libplplotd : optional requirement to produce line fit plots.

Compilation is done by simply running:
./configure && make

This produces a binary file src/robospect which can then be installed
into the user's path.

Further documentation is available in the doc directory.

*** Compilation problems ***

The two most common issues that prevent compilation are missing
libraries and incompatible build tools.  These should be reasonably
easy to fix.  Missing library locations can be appended to the
AM_CFLAGS variable in the src/Makefile.am file.  libgsl supplies a
gsl-config command that can provide information about the installation
state.  gsl-config --cflags and/or gsl-config --libs should give the
information needed.

In the case of build incompatibility, the easiest solution is to run
the command sequence:

aclocal
autoconf
automake --add-missing

to ensure that the local build matches the tools installed.

*** Usage ***

The default parameters for ROBOSPECT should produce useful results,
but here are a few examples to illustrate standard uses:

## Print help page with all command line parameters
robospect -h

## Run a normal fit on input stellar absorption spectra example.dat,
## saving results to rs.out.  ROBOSPECT will attempt to find all lines
## to fit.  robospect -F -P rs.out example.dat

## As above, but using a specified linelist to fit from.
robospect -L lines.dat -F -P rs.out example.dat

## As above, with verbosity increased to show line fitting activity
robospect -L lines.dat -F -P rs.out example.dat -v line -v screen

## Fit a flux calibrated spectrum, changing the continuum size to match
## an increase in resolution:
robospect -L lines.dat -F -P rs.out fc_example.dat --loosen --flux_calibrated -V 10
